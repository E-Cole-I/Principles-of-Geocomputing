    "Welcome back! We will continue to build off some of the things we were introduced to in lab 5. (Use the same data) In lab 5, we were mostly using some of rasterio's built in operations. Obviously this is neat, but there is so much more that can be done. We will be using rasterio in this portion of the lab, but I encourage you to play around with numpy on your own! Hopefully the introduction and the documentation give you a place to start. As you think about our 2D raster, if things start to make sense, think about how a 3D raster may be stored as data in Python. Don't worry, we won't be working with any 3D data yet! In the cells below, use some of your skills that you picked up in lab 5 to complete the rest of the lab. \n",

    "The imagery dataset is a Landsat .tif image that downloaded from USGS. The raster data structure consists of an array of cells. (Similar to a nested list) Each cell in a raster represents a pixel value which portrays that portion of the landscape. Landsat's resolution is 30 meters, so each cell represents a 30 x 30 square on the Earth. What does this mean? The resolution of Landsat imagery is rather coarse when compared to other imagery such as Sentinel, PlanetScope, or RapidEye. This isn't always bad! Sometimes, people want to study global trends in agriculture, forest, etc where Landsat is very appropriate. (And it's free!) We are using Landsat 5, but there is a number of other Landsat satellites. (RIP Landsat 6) Landsat 9 is set to be launched in 2020! As the resolution of imagery increases, the data increases as well. For example, if you're using 1,000 images in a project, this is something that you should pay attention to. At the beginning of the lab, there is a picture of two Dove Satellites. These are considered Cubesats which are changing the landscape of remote sensing and GIS. For more information about this, read this https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cubesats/overview. The problem then shifts from having a limited amount of imagery to having too much! (Kind of) But that's where coders, such as yourself, come into play. \n",

    "For the future (Not needed in this lab!), a good spot to find free imagery is Earth Explorer. https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ You will need to make an account, but you get access to the Landsat archive as well as other imagery. They even have a Python script to download a lot of imagery at once, or what is referred to as a batch download. Here, you may get a GeoTiff with 7 separate layers if downloading Landsat. (One for each band) You may want to use numpy if you're staying in Python or need to do it for many images. For testing, the Composite Bands (Data Management) tool in ArcGIS can also be of assistance. \n",
