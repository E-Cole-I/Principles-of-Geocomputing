    "Welcome! Now we will start working with raster data. If you haven't downloaded the material from moodle, please do so now. \n",
    "\n",
    "The imagery dataset is a Landsat .tif image that downloaded from USGS. The raster data structure consists of an array of cells. (Similar to a nested list) Each cell in a raster represents a pixel value which portrays that portion of the landscape. Landsat's resolution is 30 meters, so each cell represents a 30 x 30 square on the Earth. What does this mean? The resolution of Landsat imagery is rather coarse when compared to other imagery such as Sentinel, PlanetScope, or RapidEye. This isn't always bad! Sometimes, people want to study global trends in agriculture, forest, etc where Landsat is very appropriate. (And it's free!) We are using Landsat 5, but there is a number of other Landsat satellites. (RIP Landsat 6) Landsat 9 is set to be launched in 2020! As the resolution of imagery increases, the data increases as well. For example, if you're using 1,000 images in a project, this is something that you should pay attention to. At the beginning of the lab, there is a picture of two Dove Satellites. These are considered Cubesats which are changing the landscape of remote sensing and GIS. For more information about this, read this https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cubesats/overview. The problem then shifts from having a limited amount of imagery to having too much! (Kind of) But that's where coders, such as yourself, come into play. \n",

    "In this course, we won't talk a whole lot about the science of remote sensing. Our objective is to have you understand and work with this type of data. If you want to learn more about remote sensing, consider taking a course with Professor Joe Knight. In this lab, we use rasterio, but this is not the only package that can be used for this type of thing.(numpy is another popular package for arrays.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the future (Not needed in this lab!), a good spot to find free imagery is Earth Explorer. https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ You will need to make an account, but you get access to the Landsat archive as well as other imagery. They even have a Python script to download a lot of imagery at once, or what is referred to as a batch download. Here, you may get a GeoTiff with 7 separate layers if downloading Landsat. (One for each band) You may want to use numpy if you're staying in Python or need to do it for many images. For testing, the Composite Bands (Data Management) tool in ArcGIS can also be of assistance. \n",
